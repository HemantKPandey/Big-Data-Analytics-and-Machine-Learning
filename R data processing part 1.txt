Question 1:
The following command creates a vector, z.
	z<- c(45,56,78)

But can you also name each element of vector, for example, as below:
	z<- c(a=45, b=56,c=78)

Answer1:  Yes, it will be read as below :
> z<- c(45,56,78)
> z
[1] 45 56 78
>   z<- c(a=45, b=56,c=78)
> z
 a  b  c 
45 56 78

Question 2:
Is it necessary that the naming label be within quotes? Which of the
following is correct, or both are:

	x<- c(abc="AB", cde= "FF", hh = "dsf")
	OR?
	x<- c("abc"="AB", "cde"= "FF", "hh" = "dsf")

Answer:both are correct, naming labels may be and may not be within Quotes

Question 3:
In R or RStudio, type:
	example(data.frame)

And you get lots of examples on data.frame command. Where do you
think the examples are coming from?

Answer: Examples are coming from Description file from R Base package


Question 4: 
You can install many of the software from within R. Perform the following steps to
download Rtools.exe and install it on your machine. Rtools.exe is used to compile
R packages available in sourcecode form.

	install.packages("installr")
	library(installr)
	install.Rtools()
Answer : Package: installr has been successfully installed	by first command.
			Library of Installr is loaded by second command.
			3rd command tries to download and install Rtools and related packages and libraries: which was aborted, since I have already have the same version of Rtools already installed.
Log files for the execustion of the 3 commands is as below :

Question 5:
After you have performed Q 4 above, execute following commands:

	library(installr)
	installr()

A window appears to show you what all can be installed. Install NppToR.
With NppToR, you can issue all R-commands directly from notepad++.

Answer
[> installr()
Please wait a moment while downloading (you may not see R respond for half a minute)

Question 6:
For many packages (not commands), R has extensive documentation available
on your machine. Type the following command and  write randomly three packages
on which vignettes are available:

	vignette()

	Answer : Vignette are available in ‘corrplot’ , ‘dplyr’ , ‘utils’
	
Question7:
Some of the vignettes are quite detailed and yet simple. For example,
install packages: 'nycflights13' and 'dplyr'. Execute few examples provided
in the following vignette:

	vignette('dplyr')

Package, dplyr, is very useful for data manipulation

Answer: > vignette('dplyr')
starting httpd help server ... done
The command opens the detailed help of Package and its description in html rendering any editing or modification

Question 8:
What is the result of following function:
	cos(c(0, pi, pi/4, pi/2, pi))

What do you conclude from the results?
Answer : 
> cos(c(0, pi, pi/4, pi/2, pi))
[1]  1.000000e+00 -1.000000e+00  7.071068e-01  6.123032e-17 -1.000000e+00

The Value of Cosine function corresponding to the value of Angle in the vector.

Question 9:
In R, even a scalar is a vector. Try:

	d<-7
	class(d)

What is the output?
Answer: The scalar is stored as Vector fo single row and single column
>   d<-7
> d
[1] 7
> class(d)
[1] "numeric"

The Class of the scalar is Numeric

Question 10:
R supoorts four special numeric values: Inf, -Inf, NaN and NA .
	Inf : Infinity
	-Inf: Minus infinity
	NaN : Not a number
	NA : missing value.
Now perform the following operations:

	c(Inf + 1, -Inf +1, Inf - Inf)
	c(1/Inf, Inf/1, Inf/Inf)
	c(sqrt(Inf), sin(Inf))
	c(NA + NA, NA + NaN, NaN + NA, NaN + NaN)
What answers you get? Are they expected?

Answer:
> c(Inf + 1, -Inf +1, Inf - Inf)
[1]  Inf -Inf  NaN
> c(1/Inf, Inf/1, Inf/Inf)
[1]   0 Inf NaN
> c(sqrt(Inf), sin(Inf))
[1] Inf NaN
Warning message:
In sin(Inf) : NaNs produced
> c(NA + NA, NA + NaN, NaN + NA, NaN + NaN)
[1]  NA  NA NaN NaN
upto command 3 the results were expected but for the fourth one, The result is not expected as it is not in conjunction with commutative law of addition

Question 11:
Logical vectors has following operators:
 !   is used for not
 &   is used for and
 |   is used for or

Generate two logical vectors, x and y as follows:
x <- 1:10 >= 5
y <- 1:10 %% 2 == 0    # %% returns the remainder from division

Now answer the results of following:
	!x
	x & y
	x | y
Answer :
!x should come as 1,2,3,4
>   !x
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
x & y should come as 6,8,10
> x & y
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
x | y should give 2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
> x | y
 [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

Question 12:
Create following variables:
	xrt <- c(1,2,3)
	try <- c(3,4,5)
Remove from memory ONLY these two variables with rm() command.

Answer:
> #  Create following variables:
>   xrt <- c(1,2,3)
> try <- c(3,4,5)
> ls()
 [1] "d"   "d.0" "d0"  "d00" "dd"  "fac" "L3"  "try" "x"   "xrt" "y"   "z"  
> rm(xrt,try)
> ls()
 [1] "d"   "d.0" "d0"  "d00" "dd"  "fac" "L3"  "x"   "y"   "z"
 
Question 13:
Do factors help in reducing memory usgae? Try the following:

	z<-rep(c("abc", "cde"), 1000)
	z
	object.size(z)
	zz <- as.factor(z)
	object.size(zz)

What is your answer?

Answer: Yes, when fectors help inreducing the memory size.
>   z<-rep(c("abc", "cde"), 1000)
> z
